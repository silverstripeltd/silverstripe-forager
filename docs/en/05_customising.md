# Customising

The goal of this module is to provide a set of useful abstraction layers upon which developers
can build search-as-a-service integrations that best suit their needs. This section of the document covers the customisation of those abstraction layers.

> **Note**
> This kind of customisation is designed for adding new search providers or supporting non-silverstripe data types (such as JSON files or content from some other system) and not general use. For more general information refer to the [Usage](./03_usage.md) and [Configuration](./02_configuration.md) documentation.
