# Migrating from [Silverstripe Search Service](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-search-service)

There should be no functional/logic changes as part of Forager `1.0.0`, the only breaking change is the namespace of
classes.

Before: `SilverStripe\SearchService`\
After: `SilverStripe\Forager`
